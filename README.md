I first created the HTML I wanted to use for the gallery. When I was happy with how flex was working for resizing, I began to rewrite it as JavaScript push commands. I was easily able to get that to work, however I struggled getting the images to open in a new layer. I also struggled to get text working on hover. I initially had all the images load via a loop, but when it came time to add alt text to each image, I just couldn't find the syntax for it and switched to manually pushing each image one line at a time.

I ended up starting over eight times and I still couldn't get all the functionality working the way I wanted to. One gallery had images opening larger, but then I couldn't also get hover alt text to work. Another version, I got hover alt text to work, but I couldn't stop it from breaking all the images. 

I can do most of it using just HTML and CSS, but involving JavaScript, and trying to learn from tutorials on the internet wasn't helpful. 30 hours later, I'm submitting as much as I could get working in a polished fashion. I prefer simple and elegant over fancy. I attempted to get transitions to work, but I couldn't get them to work with JavaScript.

Things I couldn't get to work:
-opening an image dynamically in a new Z-layer
-keyboard closing an image after it opens (this is easy eventhandling, if I could get an image to load properly)
-dynamically loading images based on the window size within JavaScript

In the end I decided to submit this version of my gallery because all the more complicated ones broke and I couldn't figure out how to fix them. I have learned that I'm not very good at JavaScript. Hopefully I'll figure out how to get some of the functionality working before the final assignment is submitted. I am very detail oriented and if I can't get something perfect, it's difficult for me to get motivated and submit something incomplete.
